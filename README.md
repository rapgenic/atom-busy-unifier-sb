# atom-busy-unifier (steelbrain edition)

At the moment two "busy" packages exist:

* [busy](https://github.com/noseglid/atom-busy) by [noseglid](https://github.com/noseglid/)
* [busy-signal](https://github.com/steelbrain/busy-signal) by [steelbrain](https://github.com/steelbrain/)

They do exactly the same thing. They have a almost the same API and functionalities. But there are two of them.

This package (ironically installing another one seems to be the only solution) acts as a bridge between `busy` and `busy-signal`, pretending to be `busy`.

`busy` must not be installed for this package to work
